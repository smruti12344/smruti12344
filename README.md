# Job Portal

A job portal application built using **J2EE** concepts, where users (job seekers and employers) can search for jobs, apply, and manage job postings.

**Preview**: [Job Portal GitHub Repository](https://github.com/smruti12344/Job_Portal)

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for job seekers and employers using **J2EE Form-Based Authentication**.
- **Job Listings**: Employers can create, update, and manage job listings.
- **Job Search**: Job seekers can search for job openings based on various criteria such as keywords, location, and job type.
- **Application Management**: Job seekers can apply for jobs with resumes, and employers can view and manage applications.
- **Dashboard**: Personalized dashboards for job seekers and employers to track applications and job postings.
- **Admin Panel**: Role-based access control allows admins to moderate job listings and manage users.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using **JSP**, **HTML**, and **Bootstrap** for a responsive UI.
- **Database**: Managed via **JDBC** for direct interaction with a **MySQL** database.

## J2EE Concepts Used

1. **Servlets**:
   - Used for handling HTTP requests and responses. Core operations (job posting, job search, user authentication) are managed by servlets.
   - Example: `JobServlet` for managing job listings and `AuthServlet` for handling user login and registration.

2. **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**:
   - JSP is used to render the frontend dynamically, with forms for job applications, dashboards, and job listings.
   - Example: `jobs.jsp` for displaying job listings, `dashboard.jsp` for user dashboards.

3. **EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans)**:
   - Stateless EJBs are used for business logic, such as posting jobs, managing applications, and handling user registration.
   - Example: `JobManagementBean` for job-related operations, `UserManagementBean` for authentication and user management.

4. **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**:
   - JDBC is used to manage the connection and interaction between Java and the **MySQL** database.
   - Example: Direct SQL queries for job posting, searching, and user management using JDBC.

5. **J2EE Security**:
   - **Form-Based Authentication** is implemented for login and user role management (job seekers, employers, admins).
   - Role-based access control ensures different permissions for different users.

6. **JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface)**:
   - Used to manage resources like database connections and EJB references via standardized access.
   - Example: Database connection pooling managed by JNDI.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Servlets, JSP, EJB, JDBC.
- **Frontend**: JSP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
- **Database**: MySQL, managed using **JDBC** for database interaction.
- **Build Tool**: Maven.
- **Server**: Deployed on **Tomcat** or **GlassFish** server.
